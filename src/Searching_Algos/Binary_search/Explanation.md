# Binary Search

Binary search is a fast search algorithm with run-time complexity of `ÎŸ(log n)`. This search algorithm works on the principle of `divide and conquer`. For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in the `sorted form`.

Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middle most item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of item is returned. If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-array to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-array to the right of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of the subarray reduces to zero.

## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` of n elements in `sorted` order, write a function to search a given element `x` in `arr[]`.(Array indexing 0-based, i.e,  `[0,1,...,n-1]` where n is the size of the array). If `x` is not present in the array return `-1`.

## Solution

Let the given array be

and the number to be searched be 31.

First determine the left and right ends of the array 
> left = 0 and right = n-1 (here n = 10, the size of array).
> Thus middle = left + (right - left) / 2 .

Now, compare the arr[mid] value with x (value to be found). 
If `arr[mid] > x`, then we can say x lies to the left of mid. Else if `arr[mid] < x`, then x lies to the right of mid, else if `arr[mid] == x` we have found our ans.
> Here arr[mid] < 31, thus we change our left = mid+1 and mid = left + (right - left) / 2

> Here arr[mid] > 31, thus we change our right = mid-1 and mid = left + (right - left) / 2

> Finally arr[mid] = 31, thus the required pos is mid, where mid = 5

```cpp
int binarySearch(int arr[],int n, int x){
    int left=0, right=n-1;
    while(left<right){
        int mid=left+(right-left)/2;
        if(arr[mid]>x){
            right=mid-1;
        }
        else if(arr[mid]<x){
            left=mid+1;
        }
        else if(arr[mid]==x){
            return mid;
        }
    }
    return -1; // if x is not present in the array
}
```
## Time Complexity

As mentioned earlier, Binary Search is the fastest algorithm with the time complexity of O(log<sub>2</sub>n).

As we keep dividing the array to half it's current size at each iteration, thus the size of the array decreases logarithmically. 

At iteration 1:

> length = n

At iteration 2:

> lemght = n/2

At iteration 3:

> lenght = (n/2)/2 = n/4

At iteration k:

> lenght = 1;
> Or lenght = n / ( 2 ^ ( k - 1 ) ) = log<sub>2</sub>n

## Know These

### upper_ bound:

In-built C++ function, which takes an array or a vector and a value ( say  `x` ) as input and returns a iterator that points to a value **just greater** than the provided value. ( works on a sorted array / vector ).
If there are multiple such values, the one that makes first occurance is returned.

```cpp
vector<int> v;
int x;
int pos = upper_bound( v.begin() , v.end(), x) - v.begin();
```

### lower_bound:

In-built C++ function, which takes an array or a vector and a value ( say  `x` ) as input and returns an iterator that points to the value **not less** than the provided value. ( works on a sorted array / vector ). If there are multiple such values, the one that makes first occurance is returned.

```cpp
vector<int> v;
int x;
int pos = lower_bound( v.begin() , v.end() , x) - v.begin();
```

If no such value is available, both the functions return an iterator pointing to the end of the array / vector .
