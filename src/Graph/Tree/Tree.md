## **Tree**

We can define *Tree* as a connected undirected graph with *no cycles* .

There are some more ways we can define Tree . Here are some equivalent definitions : 

- connected undirected graph with N nodes  and N-1 edges.
- connected undirected graph with only unique paths i.e there is one and only path from one node to another.
- connected undirected graph where if you remove 1 edge it no longer remains connected.
